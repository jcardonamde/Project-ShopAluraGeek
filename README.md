:page_facing_up: **User Story**

AluraGeek wants to reach more customers and increase its sales, so they plan to implement an e-commerce platform to take the company to the next level and embrace digital transformation.

To achieve this, they are requesting our help as developers. The e-commerce platform must meet the following requirements:

* A home page that includes a login button and a search engine for browsing the products offered by the company.
* A banner displaying discounts, promotions, or relevant information.
* A product gallery showcasing product details such as an image, product name, price, and a link to the product description page.
* A product details page containing the product image, name, description, and price.
* A footer with a contact form and other relevant information.
* A login form to authenticate users who need access to the admin menu.
* An admin menu where users can add, edit, search, or delete products from the store.
* The website must be responsive, ensuring that customers can easily shop using mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones.
